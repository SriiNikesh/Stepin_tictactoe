In our program the moves taken by the computer and the human are chosen randomly. We use rand() function for this.
The program is in not played optimally by both sides because the moves are chosen randomly. The program can be easily modified so that both players play optimally (which will fall under the category of Artificial Intelligence). 
Also the program can be modified such that the user himself gives the input (using scanf() or cin).
Winning Strategy – An Interesting Fact
If both the players play optimally then it is destined that you will never lose (“although the match can still be drawn”). It doesn’t matter whether you play first or second.In another ways – “ Two expert players will always draw ”.
Isn’t this interesting ?
