Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game with two symbols denoting the two players: X and O. The playing board is a 3x3 square.

The rules are as follows:
Each player takes a turn placing his character (X or O) into one of the nine squares.
A player cannot place his symbol in a square that is already occupied by a symbol.
The game ends when a player creates a winning combination of his symbols or when there are no empty squares remaining.
Winning combination is defined as three horizontally adjacent, three vertically adjacent, or three diagonally adjacent symbols.
If neither player creates a winning combination when all nine squares are occupied, the game is a draw, often referred to as a "cat game."
